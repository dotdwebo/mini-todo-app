# mini-todo-app
A Simple Project by a React Newbie


Mini Todo App is an application that aims to create to-do-lists.
You can create, edit, cancel, check, and delete data on the form.
This app is made to learn the basics of ReactJS.
This application does not involve a database management system (such as: mysql, mariadb, postgresql, mongodb, and the like).
I only included babel for basic configuration on javascript.
