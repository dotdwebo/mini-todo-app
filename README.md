# mini-todo-app
### A Simple Project by a React Newbie


**Mini Todo App** is an application that aims to create to-do-lists. You can input, edit, cancel, check, and delete data on the form.
This application is made to learn the basics of ReactJS. This application does not involve a database management system (such as: mysql, mariadb, postgresql, mongodb, and the like).


-- This application involves babel (https://babeljs.io) for basic configuration on javascript. 

-- This application also adds lite-server (https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server) for server use on localhost (development only).


To run the application, please type on your terminal:

`npm run start`

Then the program will **run the lite-server**, **transpile jsx file from src folder to public folder automatically**, and **provide real time updates via the --watch feature on babel**.


If you're interested, feel free to fork and refactor some of the code here to make it more effective and efficient.
