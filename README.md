# mini-todo-app
A Simple Project by a React Newbie


Mini Todo App is an application that aims to create to-do-lists. You can input, edit, cancel, check, and delete data on the form.
This app is made to learn the basics of ReactJS. This application does not involve a database management system (such as: mysql, mariadb, postgresql, mongodb, and the like).


-- This application involves babel (https://babeljs.io) for basic configuration on javascript. 

-- This application also adds lite-server (https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server) for server use on localhost (development only).

If you're interested, feel free to fork and refactor some of the code here to make it more effective and efficient.
