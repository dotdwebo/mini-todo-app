## Description

**Mini Todo App** is an application that aims to create to-do-lists. You can input, edit, cancel, check, and delete data on the form.
This application is made to learn the basics of ReactJS. This application does not involve a database management system (such as: mysql, mariadb, postgresql, mongodb, and the like).

***
## Requirement

- Make sure Node JS and NPM are installed on your computer.
 


***
## Main Packages

- ReactJS CDN (https://reactjs.org): For building User Interface (UI) based on UI components.
- BabelJS CDN (https://babeljs.io) : For transpiling JSX to any JS that is suitable on the most browsers.
- Lite-Server (https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server) : For serving a webapp, providing a fallback for browser history API, and loading in the browser. (development only)

***
## Run the Application

Change your directory to the repo located:

>
> ### `cd mini-todo-app`
>

Type on your terminal, to run the application:

>
> ### `  npm run start `
>


Then the program will:

  - **Run the lite-server (on localhost:3000 or localhost:3001)**,
  
  - **Transpile JSX file from src/ folder to public/ folder automatically**, and 
  
  - **Provide real time updates via the --watch feature on babel**.
